To set up a proxy server on Ubuntu, you can use Squid, a popular open-source proxy server. Below are the steps to install and configure Squid on Ubuntu:

1. Install Squid
First, update your package lists and install Squid:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install squid -y

2. Configure Squid
After installing Squid, you need to configure it by editing the squid.conf file.

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf

3. Basic Configuration Settings
Here are some essential settings to configure in the squid.conf file:

a. Set the Port
By default, Squid listens on port 3128. You can change it if necessary:

bash
Copy code
http_port 3128

b. Allow Access
By default, Squid only allows access from the localhost. If you want to allow access from specific IP addresses or subnets, you need to configure ACLs (Access Control Lists).

For example, to allow access from the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet:

bash
Copy code
acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24
http_access allow localnet
To allow access from all IPs (not recommended for security reasons):

bash
Copy code
http_access allow all
Make sure you remove or comment out the following line to avoid blocking all traffic:

bash
Copy code
http_access deny all

c. Configure DNS
Ensure Squid uses the correct DNS server. You can configure this by editing the resolv.conf file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
Add your DNS server:

bash
Copy code
nameserver 8.8.8.8   # Example: Google DNS
d. Configure Logging
By default, Squid logs to /var/log/squid/access.log. You can configure the log format and rotation by editing the following lines in squid.conf:

bash
Copy code
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log squid
4. Restart Squid
After making changes, restart the Squid service to apply the new configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart squid

5. Enable Squid to Start on Boot
To ensure Squid starts on system boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable squid
6. Firewall Configuration (Optional)
If you have a firewall running, make sure to allow traffic on the Squid port (default 3128):

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 3128/tcp
7. Testing the Proxy
Test your proxy setup by using curl or configuring a browser to use your Squid proxy. Here's an example using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -x http://<your_server_ip>:3128 http://example.com
