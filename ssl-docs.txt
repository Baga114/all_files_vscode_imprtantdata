1. Generate CSR
below is the command 
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout yourdomain.key -out yourdomain.csr

This will generate two files:

yourdomain.key: The private key (keep this secure).
yourdomain.csr: The CSR file that you'll provide to the CA.

2. Submit CSR to the CA
Once the CSR is generated, submit it to the CA when purchasing the SSL. The CA may also ask you to verify your domain ownership (by email or DNS record).
below how you gonna add them
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key;
ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/privateca_bundle.crt;

how to create bundle files
so u r saying that i will get the bundle file from cv websites where i buy the ssl
If the CA provides intermediate certificates separately, you may need to create a ca_bundle.crt by combining these intermediate certificates.
Sometimes the CA provides a bundled file already
